            <h3>About 1</h3>
            Bina has a good interest on cooking foods. She thinks that if we keep our diet at kitchen healthy; we all would be healthy.
            She always focus on balanced diet. She likes to make menu with low sugar  and salt. If we eat healthy foods,
             it's a less chance to be a regular patient to go in a hospital. She thinks that 
             it's better to spend time on cooking and buying fresh food rather than taking recent researched medical molecules every day.
