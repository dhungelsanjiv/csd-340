                        I like to read latest books. I have found our local public library as one of the greatest resource to get those books. 
                        Sometime I order books as interlibrary loan also.When I had been in the library at the first time; 
                        I saw one sentence as " Library is for ages" and other as "Open the world through the library."After that I had been there regularly and reading a lot of books.
                        It's a fun to read new books and to get new ideas before anybody said that as new things.

                        I like to be more social. When I get time; I try to invite some of my friends to my apartment or try to go in their house. 
                        If I did not get a chance to meet physically; at least I call them and say hi and ask about their problems and share own conditions.
                        When I meet with my relatives or friends; I feel cool and less stressed. I have considered the meeting with friends and relatives as a stress management tool.
                        The picture I had taken was on our winter break when I had been to Kansas-City in my cousins apartment.

                        I am a person who always like to do new things. For that; I continuously reading new books and researching on the web.
                        After joining to this cohort; I have done so many research to write different posts. 
                        I have to search even a tiny problems on the web as it is tricky to get exact solution of the codes of the programming language.
                        Not only in my study; I like to research new items which could make our life comfortable by using different tools.I have found that technology has been high and our lives have been easier nowadays.

                        When I had been in my school years; I used to like Mathematics; Science and English. Most of the students would be weak in Math, Science and English in my back home. 
                        I used to plan if I knew these subjects well; I could teach and make the concepts easy for those students and I could earn a lot of money as a return. So, when I was in college life ; I became independent by teaching high school students.
                        It was a good source of money for me to pay my tuition fee in my college in my Back-Home.

                        I have worked as a medical sales representative upto 7 years before I moved to USA. 
                        It was a good experience to meet with doctors and pharmacists and give them ideas about own product.
                        I think that was one of the good experiences of life and utilizing those skills nowadays also. The skills learned from marketing is 
                        to deal with people of different ideas and move forwards by adjusting everything. I had learnt how to move forward even we do have different ideology.
                        I think it's a marketing which makes people perfect.

                        After moving to the USA in 2013; I joined to American Express (AMEX) for the processing of credit cards. It was a challenging job to ship the mails on due dates.
                        But we had in a good team;and we were able to ship the mails before the deadline. If the team work is not efficient and effective; we might have been failed to achieve the goal.
                        I not only learned how to team work; I had also learned how to do a quality job. It's a challenging in a team; but if the tuning is good among the group members; the output would be more than expected.
