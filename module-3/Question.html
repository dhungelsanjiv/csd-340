    Create a new directory under the csd-340 and name it module-3
    Create a new HTML document and name it <yourLastName_EX2>.html and add it to your module-3 directory
    Create a new CSS document and name it <yourLastName_EX2>.css and add it to your module-3 directory

    Using Google Fonts – create a kit that includes Oswald (300, 500, 700) and Quattrocento (400, 700)
        Hint: see the videos “Font-family, Google fonts, and Font-face”

        In the <head> of the HTML document add four (4) meta tags 
            Hint: see pages 191-192 for help on what I am expecting
        In the <head> of the HTML document add a link to <yourLastName_EX2>.css

        Give the HTML document a title of “CSD 340 Development with HTML and CSS” 
            Hint: this goes in the <title></title> element
        In the body of the HTML document add a <div> and give it a CSS ID of “container” 
            <body><div id=”container”></div></body>
        For the remaining HTML sections, we will be adding paragraphs of text and formatting to resemble creating a page from a book
            Add an h1 tag and give this header a book title 
            Add an h2 tag and give this header a chapter title 
            Visit https://lipsum.com/ and generate four (4) new paragraphs
            Wrap each paragraph in <p> tags 
            Give the first paragraph a CSS class of “intro”
            Pick a single sentence in any of the paragraphs and apply a CSS class of “sentence” to it

                    Hint: use the <address></address> element
                Put each part of the address on its own line, as you would address an envelope you mail (use the paragraph tag)
                    First line: Bellevue University (website link)
                    Second line: street address
                    Third line: city, state, zip
